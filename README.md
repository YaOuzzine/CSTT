### **4. Key Features**
#### **4.1. Test Case Generation**
- **Input**: Requirements in plain text, user stories, or formal specifications.
- **Functionality**:
  - Parse requirements and identify functional and edge cases.
  - Suggest test scenarios for different testing types (functional, regression, boundary testing).
  - Generate test cases in various formats (Excel, CSV, JSON).
#### **4.2. Test Data Generation**
- **Customization**:
  - Generate data for specific domains (e.g., e-commerce, banking).
  - Support for various formats: JSON, XML, CSV, SQL scripts.
  - Data templates for names, dates, addresses, financial information, etc.
- **Dynamic Data Sets**:
  - Enable dependencies and relationships between data fields (e.g., relational database structures).
#### **4.3. Defect Analysis Dashboard**
- **Defect Visualization**:
  - Real-time charts and graphs (e.g., severity distribution, trends over time).
  - Root cause analysis suggestions using machine learning.
- **Metrics and KPIs**:
  - Bug severity, priority distribution, resolution time, and defect density.
- **Insights**:
  - AI-powered recommendations for process improvements based on defect trends.

### **5. Technical Architecture**
#### **5.1. System Overview**
The system is designed as a web-based SaaS platform using the following architecture:
- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
  - Next-UI for components and theming.
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js for REST API development.
  - Python (Django) for machine learning-based services.
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL for storing test cases, test data, and defect information.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - OPENAI-API

#### **5.2. System Flow**
1. **Test Case and Data Generation**:
   - User inputs requirements → Parsed by NLP model → Test cases generated.
   - User defines data templates → Data generator produces data.
2. **Defect Analysis Dashboard**:
   - Defect data pulled via APIs → Processed and visualized in the dashboard.
